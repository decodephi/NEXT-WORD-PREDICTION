### ðŸ“– Next-Word Prediction using Bidirectional LSTMs and GRU

### ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains a Next-Word Prediction Model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU networks. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given a sequence of preceding words. It leverages tenserflow and keras for deep learning implementation and NLTK for text preprocessing.


### ðŸ›  Features
âœ… Deep Learning Model: Uses  LSTMs and GRU to improve context awareness.
âœ… Trained on a Large Text Corpus: Enhances generalization and accuracy.
âœ… Keras Implementation: Efficient training and inference pipeline.
âœ… Tokenization with NLTK: Ensures structured preprocessing of text data.
âœ… Pre-Trained Model Included: Easily load the trained .pt file for inference.
