### ðŸ“– Next-Word Prediction using LSTMs and GRU

### ðŸš€ Project Overview
# This repository contains a Next-Word Prediction Model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU networks. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given a sequence of preceding words. It leverages tenserflow and keras for deep learning implementation and NLTK for text preprocessing.


### ðŸ›  Features
# 1. âœ… `Deep Learning Model`: Uses  LSTMs and GRU to improve context awareness.
# 2. âœ… `Trained on a Large Text Corpus`: Enhances generalization and accuracy.
# 3. âœ… `Keras Implementation`: Efficient training and inference pipeline.
# 4. âœ… `Tokenization with NLTK`: Ensures structured preprocessing of text data.
# 5. âœ… `Text data`: hamlet.txt has text data which over train the model.
# 6. âœ… `Made Interface`: Made interface using steamlit.

### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
# The repository consists of:
# next_word_predict.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full model implementation, training, and evaluation.
