ðŸ“– Next-Word Prediction using Bidirectional LSTMs and GRU

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains a Next-Word Prediction Model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU networks. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence given a sequence of preceding words. It leverages tenserflow and keras for deep learning implementation and NLTK for text preprocessing.
